# Unreal Log Parser

Compact, fast and easy to use Unreal Engine targeted Log Parser. Parses every log line with targeted verbosity into:

## Details

Original line: line
Count: line count
Verbosity: line verbosity level (e.g. Error)
Category: log category (e.g. LogAbilitySystem)
and sorts them in descending order. It also have some useful parameters:

- `-t enables telemetry`
- `-v [error|warning|display]` allows to specify minimum verbosity level to be included in the parsing process
- `-p [path to logs to parse]` allows to specify path to the folder containing logs to parse
- `-r [path to create result .txt]` allows to specify path that will be used to create result .txt in

## Usage

To use the parser you need to place your log files into the `LogsToParse` directory located at your program root or use it with a `-p` parameter to specify the path to the folder with logs to parse, e.g `LogParser.exe -p D:\MyUnrealGameProject\Build\Windows\MyGame\Saved\Logs`.

I'm planning to add more features, make the result prettier or more useful if needed and make it multithreaded ðŸ‘€
